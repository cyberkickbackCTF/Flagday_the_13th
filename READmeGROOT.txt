Hi guys! I couldnâ€™t find a cool hacker way to break into the box :(

I tried everything I could find but it seems Ubuntu machines are hard to break.

As a fall back, you simply need to decoyer the directory path and then find the encrypted password.

Use the correct cipher and it should show you to the root password to let you edit what you need.

Let me know if you have any troubles!

We finally made it to the light at the end of the Bethel cybersecurity tunnel!! woot woot

- Check the GitHub for the directions and location to get into it the other way and hopefully that will work with the encrypted password.
