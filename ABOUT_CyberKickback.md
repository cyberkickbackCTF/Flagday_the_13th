# Bethel Tech Cybersecurity Final project CTF

Hints and tricks to find these chillin flags :)

Welcome to the Cyber Kickback GitHub page which was made to intersect with our custom and built-from-scratch Capture The Flag virtual machine based on an Ubuntu Server.
We have enjoyed out time taking a swing at making our own versions and have only incorporated what we feel is nessesary to the game at hand.

We pray you enjoy your time here and have fun breaking and nabbing thoes flags! :)
