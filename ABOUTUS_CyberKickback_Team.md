# Bethel Tech Cybersecurity Final project CTF

Hints and tricks to find these chillin flags :)

Welcome to the Cyber Kickback GitHub page which was made to intersect with our custom and built-from-scratch Capture The Flag virtual machine based on an Ubuntu Server.
We have thoroughly enjoyed our time taking a swing at making our own versions and have only incorporated what we feel is nessesary to the game at hand. This was a welcomed challenge from the start but Cybersecurity is all about adapting and find a way to the soplution :)

We pray you enjoy your time here and have fun breaking and nabbing those flags! :)
