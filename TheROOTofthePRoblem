Hi guys,

Here is the directory path for the root flag folder but you have to be smart about it and look where normally stuff is hidden *wink wink*:

Oh yeah, and the location is encrypted with a cipher, just in case, figure it out to get to the right folder.

/rgp/pybhq/VnztEBBG

Try it with the usual password since you can then edit what you need but dont lose it!
